        <b>Example:</b><br>If there is free time between 9 and 12 o'clock, the optimized mode would suggest starting at 9 or 10:30 to make the best use of available times.

        title: "Professional Hair Removal with Wax"
        overview_title: "What is Waxing?"
        intro: "Waxing is a classic and proven method of hair removal where hair is removed along with the hair root using warm or hot wax. This method enables a long-lasting smooth skin feeling that often lasts up to 3–6 weeks after treatment. The hair grows back finer and less dense over time, the more regularly you wax."
        description: "Waxing (=waxing) is a type of hair removal with cosmetic wax. It is part of the regular beauty program for many men and women and offers a silky smooth skin feeling that lasts for weeks."
        how_it_works_title: "How does waxing work?"
        how_it_works_1: "Warm or hot wax is applied to the skin"
        how_it_works_2: "The wax surrounds the hair and grips it at the root"
        how_it_works_3: "By quickly pulling against the direction of hair growth, the hair is removed along with the root"
        how_it_works_4: "The hair follicle must produce a new hair, which takes time"
        hair_length_title: "Minimum hair length:"
        hair_length: "Hair should be at least 4-5 mm (0.5 cm) long to ensure the most pain-free and thorough hair removal possible. This corresponds to about 2-3 weeks of growth after the last shave."
      treatment_process:
        title: "How a Professional Waxing Treatment Works"
        step1_title: "Skin Preparation"
        step1: "The skin is cleaned and possibly lightly exfoliated so that the wax can grip optimally. Before treatment, the skin should be dry and free of creams, oils or other residues."
        step1_alt: "Gentle skin cleaning and preparation for waxing treatment"
        step2_title: "Apply Wax"
        step2: "Warm or hot wax is applied to the skin in the direction of hair growth. Professional treatments often use a roll-on system that leaves an even layer of wax."
        step2_alt: "Professional roll-on wax application technique"
        step3_title: "Apply Fabric Strip (for strip wax)"
        step3: "With the strip wax method, a fabric strip is placed on the wax layer and lightly pressed so that it adheres optimally."
        step3_alt: "Fabric strip being applied to wax layer"
        step4_title: "Remove Against Hair Growth"
        step4: "After cooling, the wax is pulled off with a quick, jerky movement against the direction of growth - including the hair. This quick movement is crucial for a pain-free result."
        step4_alt: "Professional wax removal technique against hair growth direction"
        step5_title: "Aftercare"
        step5: "After treatment, the skin is soothed and, if desired, cared for with a gentle lotion or aloe vera gel. This reduces redness and ensures well-being."
        step5_alt: "Soothing aftercare lotion application after waxing treatment"
      benefits:
        title: "Why Professional Waxing is Worth It"
        benefit1_title: "Long-Lasting Results"

        benefit2_title: "Thinner Regrowth"
        benefit2: "Hair grows back less strongly and becomes finer over time. After several treatments, hair growth is significantly reduced. No unsightly stubble like with shaving."
        benefit3_title: "Fewer Skin Irritations"
        benefit3: "No cuts or razor burn. Professional technique minimizes skin irritation. Gentler method than daily shaving."
        benefit4_title: "Thoroughness"
        benefit4: "Hair is removed at the root. Even hard-to-reach areas are thoroughly treated. Suitable for large and small body areas."
        benefit5_title: "Time Saving"
        benefit5: "No more daily shaving needed. Over time, the intervals between treatments become longer. More time for other things."
      techniques:
        title: "Warm Wax or Hot Wax? The Right Technique for Every Area"
        strip_wax_title: "Strip Wax (Warm Wax)"
        strip_wax_desc: "Classic method with fabric or cloth strips, particularly suitable for larger body areas such as legs or back."
        strip_wax_benefits: "Fast and efficient for large areas, good for beginners, more cost-effective"
        strip_wax_areas: "Legs (complete or partial), Arms, Back, Abdomen"
        hot_wax_title: "Hot Wax / Hard Wax (Film Wax)"
        hot_wax_desc: "Wax without strips, ideal for more sensitive zones such as face or intimate area - less painful and gentler on the skin."
        hot_wax_benefits: "Gentler for sensitive skin, no strips needed, more precise for small areas, less painful"
        hot_wax_areas: "Intimate area (Bikini), Face (upper lip, eyebrows), Underarms, Sensitive areas"
        temperature: "Professional warm wax should have a temperature between 43°C and 50°C to reliably remove hair. The heat widens the pores and makes hair removal easier."
      common_mistakes:
        title: "The 8 Most Common Waxing Mistakes – and How to Avoid Them"
        mistake1_title: "Mistake 1: Hair Too Short"
        mistake1_problem: "For the wax to properly grip hair, it should be at least 4–5 mm long."
        mistake1_solution: "Don't shave 2-3 weeks before the appointment. If hair is too long (over 1 cm), trim it slightly."
        mistake2_title: "Mistake 2: Too Little Preparation"
        mistake2_problem: "Showering, sauna or peels too shortly before treatment can unnecessarily irritate the skin."
        mistake2_solution: "24 hours before waxing: No sports, no sauna, no sunbathing. No peels on the day of treatment. Skin should be clean and dry."
        mistake3_title: "Mistake 3: Shaving Immediately Before Appointment"
        mistake3_problem: "Shaving only removes hair superficially and prevents optimal results with waxing."
        mistake3_solution: "Don't shave at least 2 weeks before the appointment. Hair must be grippable at the root."
        mistake4_title: "Mistake 4: Exercise Too Soon After"
        mistake4_problem: "Hot training directly after waxing can increase redness and irritation."
        mistake4_solution: "No sports 24 hours after treatment. Don't wear tight sportswear. Avoid excessive sweating."
        mistake5_title: "Mistake 5: Wrong Timing"
        mistake5_problem: "The timing of waxing has a major impact on pain perception."
        mistake5_solution: "Better avoid during period (higher pain sensitivity). Best 2 weeks before or after period. Afternoon hours are best (pain perception is lower then)."
        mistake6_title: "Mistake 6: Alcohol Before Treatment"
        mistake6_problem: "Alcohol makes the skin more sensitive and can promote bruising."
        mistake6_solution: "No alcohol 24 hours before treatment. No alcohol-containing care products before and after waxing."
        mistake7_title: "Mistake 7: Wrong or Missing Aftercare"
        mistake7_problem: "Without proper care, redness, ingrown hairs and irritation can occur."
        mistake7_solution: "Use soothing lotions like aloe vera gel. Coconut oil provides moisture and has anti-inflammatory effects. No fatty products (clog pores). Regular peeling from 2 days after treatment (2-3x per week)."
        mistake8_title: "Mistake 8: DIY Waxing Instead of Professional Treatment"
        mistake8_problem: "At home, experience, proper temperature control and professional techniques are missing."
        mistake8_solution: "Book professional treatment at a studio. Experienced beauticians know the best techniques. Professional products are higher quality than drugstore products."

        title: "Frequently Asked Questions About Waxing – Your Answers"
        q1_question: "Does waxing hurt?"
        q1_answer: "The first time it can be somewhat noticeable, but with regular treatments it usually becomes less painful. Pain perception varies depending on body region and individual sensitivity. Professional beauticians use techniques that minimize discomfort."
        q2_question: "How long does it last?"
        q2_answer: "A professional waxing can give smooth skin for up to 6 weeks. The exact duration depends on individual hair growth. With regular treatments, the intervals between appointments become longer."
        q3_question: "Can skin reactions occur?"
        q3_answer: "Slight redness or spots can occur, but usually disappear after a few hours. With proper aftercare (aloe vera gel, soothing lotions), irritation is minimized."
        q4_question: "When should you not get waxing?"
        q4_answer: "Better avoid waxing with sunburn, open wounds or recently severely irritated skin. Also with certain skin diseases such as neurodermatitis, allergies or varicose veins, you should consult a doctor first. In this case, sugaring is often the better alternative."
        q5_question: "How long must the hair be?"

        q6_answer: "Yes, with regular treatments, hair becomes thinner, softer and grows back more slowly. This is one of the great advantages of waxing."
        q7_question: "Can you get waxing while pregnant?"
        q7_answer: "Basically yes, but the skin is more sensitive during pregnancy. It is advisable to discuss this with your doctor first and choose an experienced beautician."
        q8_question: "Does age play a role in intimate waxing?"
        q8_answer: "No, age does not play a role. It is important that the skin is healthy and there are no contraindications."
        q9_question: "What can you do about ingrown hairs?"
        q9_answer: "Regular peeling (2-3x per week, from 2 days after treatment). Use moisturizer. Gentle massage of affected areas. Consult a dermatologist for severe problems."
        q10_question: "When and how often should you do a peel?"
        q10_answer: "Start from 2 days after waxing. Peel 2-3x per week. Use gentle shower peels. Don't peel too aggressively."
